Notes in python
In python to display an information we use the "Print" function or statment.
When we wanna ask information from a user we use the "Input" funtion.
The information that is displayed is usually called Strings. Strings can be either letters, numbers, or whatsoever.
Strings can be stored into variables. When you want to type a variable with more than two letters you use the underscore(_)
There are no spaces in variable. When you wanna display a string and if its letters, you use the quotes;
either double or single quotes(""/''). But when its numbers, you dont use the quotes.
Combining two strings together is called string concatenation.
